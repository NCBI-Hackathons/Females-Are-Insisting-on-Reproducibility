Choose one.  Response is obtained by report of the participant/subject or caretaker. If more detailed characterizations of ethnicity are collected to enhance data quality and consistency, it is recommended that they be ""collapsible"" up to the two categories for reportable ethnicity, as needed for reporting to FDA under its guidance. Other regulatory bodies may expect the reporting of ethnicity values which more appropriately reflect the population of their areas (e.g., Japanese ancestry for MHLW reporting to Japan). These may be collected as an extension to the suggested code list.
