# Variable-Tracking-and-Schema-Capturing-to-make-Biomedical-Research-Data-FAIR-

## Background
### All about the data
We are working with Patient Reported Data from the National Eye Institute who have gone through or about to go through LASIK Surgery. There three data categories: Demographic, Pre-Operations, Post-Operations. The Data is in PDF and unclean and non-standard Excel Format.

### More details on the data:
* CRFs: Data Dictionary + PDFs
* 1100 people
* Structure: 
* Demographic 8 DE
* Pre-OP 142 DE
* Post -OP 108 DE
* 6 data files
* 42 PDFs

## Goals
### Target: 
1. Extract schema from the data sets
* Capture inventories of the files in the directories
* Bagit and Pandas as tools
* How many variables and missing values are in each file
2. Stretch: 
* Pulling data from CRFs and PDFs as a structured data format 
* Associate the variables with the descriptions 
* Validate the variables against the data dictionary and report the record that does not find a match

## WorkFlow: 
# Input Data: 
Raw Non-standard Data + PDFs

# Automatically Transform To â€¦. (Magic Happening!)

# Output
