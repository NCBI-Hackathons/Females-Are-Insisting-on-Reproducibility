# Variable-Tracking-and-Schema-Capturing-to-make-Biomedical-Research-Data-FAIR-

## Goals
### Target: 
1. Extract schema from the data sets
* Capture inventories of the files in the directories
* Bagit and Pandas as tools
* How many variables and missing values are in each file
2. Stretch: 
* Pulling data from CRFs and PDFs as a structured data format 
* Associate the variables with the descriptions 
* Validate the variables against the data dictionary and report the record that does not find a match
